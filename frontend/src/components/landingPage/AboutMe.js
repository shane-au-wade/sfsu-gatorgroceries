    <h2>What's Gator Groceries?</h2>
    <br />
    Gator Groceries is a free service provided by the associated students 
    in partnership with the SF/Marin Foodbank for students who are experiencing 
    food insecurity. We have a weekly distribution every Monday in Annex 1 - this 
    is our main day and you can expect to get up to a weeks worth of food. We also 
    have two emergency food days on Wednesday and Thursday on the bottom floor of 
    the Cesar Chavez Student Center, these emergency food days are supplementary 
    only with limited supplies. We are not open during holidays or school breaks. <br />
    <br />
    <h2>Other Food Resources</h2>
    <br />
    The San Francisco Bay area has lots of amazing resources for people who are 
    experiencing food insecurity. Pictured on the right is a flyer for a new pantry 
    opening near campus. We highly recommend students check it out. For other resources 
    please check out the SF/Marin online food locator here: https://www.sfmfoodbank.org/find-food/ 
    This online tool has access to over 270 food pantries in the SF/Marin area. There 
    are also resources on this web page to help secure other sources of food such 
    as sign-up assistance for SNAP (EBT food stamps).
